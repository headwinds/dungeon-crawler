# Shadow Hunt

[Shadow Hunt](https://github.com/headwinds/dungeon-crawler) is a React/Redux/Python roguelike by [headwinds](https://headwinds.now.sh)

## Cabin Quest

It uses the [Cabin Quest API](https://github.com/headwinds/cabinquest) - Shadow Hunt is book 1 of my big blue sky idea to do a Cabin Quest series 
which is a bit ridiculous until I finish Shadow Hunt but hey dream big! 

# Campaign & Story Concepts

## Sylvannas

It would be fun to do some historical data experiment about the period where human and yetis co-habited. At time when [Neanderthals nursed their sick](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/neanderthal-medicine/573028/) and injured back to health with ancient medicine.
