## Contributors

PRs are welcome but before opening one please open an issue and pitch your idea as an enhancement or bug fix so that we can track changes and ensure multiple people aren't working on the same thing.

Part of the fun of building this project is creating and re-creating worlds. If you've played any RPGs, you probably have many favorite mechanics, characters, and story lines that could be built into this library. It's designed to be configurable so that each developer can explore their own design taste and turn on/off elements that don't interest them, yet still contribute to a single demo.  

From the high fantasy of Tolkien's Middle-earth to the gritty sci-fi of Alien's LV426 Acheron, it's up to you to design new skins that will work within a common system. For instance, common exists in the default dungeon world are stairs leading down, but in your world, they could be griffin towers or portals to another dimension.
